# Challenge 3 - Logic Apps

At Best For You Organics Company (BFYOC), customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance. To provide customers with the best products, BFYOC would like to provide a customer survey to collect feedback.

BFYOC would like you to use [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/) as the workflow engine and integration platform to connect all the necessary pieces for this new feature.

## Challenge

### Create a HTTP triggered Logic App

Create a new Logic App that is triggered by a HTTP request. Use the sample payload provided below to generate a schema for the incoming request.

* **Verb**: POST

* **Input payload example**:

    ``` JSON
    {
        "userId": "cc20a6fb-a91f-4192-874d-132493685376",
        "productId": "4c25613a-a3c2-4ef3-8e02-9c335eb23204",
        "userFeedback": "This is my favorite one!"
    }
    ```

### Detect the Sentiment of the User Feedback

 Detect the sentiment of the `userFeedback` field to receive a numeric score between 0 and 1. Scores close to 1 indicate a positive sentiment, while scores close to 0 are indicative of a negative sentiment.

* **Cognitive Services**: Provision an instance of Cognitive Services to support text analysis.

* **Detect Sentiment**: Retrieve the numeric score for the `userFeedback` field by leveraging one of the Cognitive Services actions for text analysis.

### Store the Feedback and Score in Cosmos DB

Add the user feedback, along with the sentiment score, to a new collection in the Cosmos DB database that was created in the previous challenge.

* **Partition key**: Use the `productId` as the partition key.
* **Feedback example**:

    ``` JSON
    {
        "id": "abc0a6fb-a93e-4192-874d-132493612126",
        "productId": "4c25613a-a3c2-4ef3-8e02-9c335eb23204",
        "userId": "cc20a6fb-a91f-4192-874d-132493685376",
        "userFeedback": "This is my favorite one!",
        "score": "0.982596516609192"
    }
    ```

### Email Notifications for Feedback

BFYOC would like to notify their customer service representatives immediately if there are any unfavorable comments.

* **Conditional logic**: When sentiment analysis score is below `.70`, send an email from the Logic App to an address that you can monitor.
* **Email**: Select an action from the list of email providers (examples: Office 365, SendGrid and Gmail)
* **Contents**: Include in the email body the sentiment score and user feedback.

## Success Criteria

* Invoke the Logic App with a HTTP request from a client such as [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
* Test with both negative and positive feedback results.
* Confirm that emails are sent only for scores below `.70`.
* Review and inspect the run history of the Logic App to validate the results.
